# Asana Tweaks (Unofficial Browser Extension)

A browser extension to add small enhancements to the Asana project management system.

## Current Features

* Adds an "Inbox" link to the top right toolbar, so you don't need to open the sidebar.
* Fits better in narrower windows, for example if you have the browser sidebar open.
* Adds an option to the right-click menu to paste your OS/browser details — useful when reporting bugs.
* Changes the "Reports" sidebar heading to "Reports & Saved Searches".
* In list view, if a task name is truncated, the full task name is shown in a tooltip on hover.
